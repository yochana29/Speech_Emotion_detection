Speech Emotion Detection Project
Objective: Develop a deep learning-based system to accurately detect 
and classify emotions in speech recordings, including happiness, sadness,
anger, fear, surprise, and neutral.

Data Collection: Utilize a diverse dataset of audio recordings labeled 
with corresponding emotions, ensuring a range of speakers and emotional expressions.

Feature Extraction: Extract audio features using techniques such as Mel-frequency 
cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and pitch analysis, which serve as inputs for the model.

Model Development: Implement and train deep learning models, including Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to classify emotions 
based on the extracted features.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score, along with confusion matrices for detailed insights 
into emotion classification.
